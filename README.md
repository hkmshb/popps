# POPPS

POPulation Processing Scripts (POPPS): scripts to reshape and distill
population data into a form usable for analysis and by applications.

## Note

We've agreed not to recreate the views `boundaries` and `fe_settlements` within the `vts_pop` schema, rather we'd use those that already exist with the `grid_data` schema.
